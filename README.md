# poker-probability
analytical and simulated solution to poker,  there are some possible hands to win, but what is the probability to get every single one? The question is simple, if you have 5 poker cards what is the probability of getting a pair, two pairs, a trio, a Full or a poker?



In the code in this repository, a method is presented to recognize the kind of hand generated in every simulation loop in a poker game.

Is counted the number of appearances of every rank in a hand, if this counter is equals to 1, there is a pair, 2->two pair, , 3-> a trio, 5->full , 6->poker

the counter will never be equals to 4 because the amount of cards.
The method was developed by Fernando Ruiz, this algorithm presents a verified solution to the hand poker problem.
